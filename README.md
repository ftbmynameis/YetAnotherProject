# YetAnotherProject
#### What is this repo or project?
A small project to learn and use the new c++ standard and get back into c++ programming as well as using and practicing the skills and things I've learned as a fulltime dev on a private project.
For the sake of having something to do and since I've started as a game dev, when I've learned programming the goal of this is to have a "small playable" game of some sorts. 

###### Roadmap
- Project setup - done
- Render a simple animated (2d / 3d rotating) triangle
- Simple controls to move around
- Render some 3D cubes
- Move around with a "player" like object, without collision
- Add simple collision
- Add Shadows
